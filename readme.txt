Adds a shortcode button to the WordPress TinyMCE editor for easy anti spambot email links.

== Description ==

Adds a button to the TinyMCE editor that puts a selected email adress into a shortcode [email] and turns it into a mailto-link, which uses WordPress' native antispambot() function to encode the emailadress so harvesters can't get it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place an emailadress in your post or page, select it and press the email button in the WYSIWYG editor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
